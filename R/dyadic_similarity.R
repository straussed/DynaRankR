#' Compare two rank orderings 
#' 
#' This function compares two rank orderings that have the same elements. 
#'      For an order of length \emph{n} 
#'      there are \emph{n choose 2} dyadic relationships implied by that order. 
#'      For example, the order {a, b, c} implies that a > b, a  > c, and b > c.
#'      The dyadic similarity between two orders is the proportion of implied 
#'      dyadic relationships that are shared by the two orders. 
#' 
#' @param order1 The first rank ordering to be compared. Alternatively, this can
#'               be supplied as an interaction matrix with identities as the dimension names.
#'               All identities in order1 must be in order2. 
#' @param order2 The second rank ordering to be compared. Alternatively, this can
#'               be supplied as an interaction matrixwith identities as the dimension names. 
#'               All identities in order2 must be in order1.
#' 
#' @return The proportion of dyadic relationship that are shared by the two orders
#'         This value is 1 if the orders are identical and 0 if the orders are
#'         exact opposites.
