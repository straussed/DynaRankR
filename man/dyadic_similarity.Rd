\title{Compare two rank orderings}
\usage{
dyadic_similarity(order1, order2)
}
\arguments{
\item{order1}{The first rank ordering to be compared. Alternatively, this can
be supplied as an interaction matrix with identities as the dimension names.
All identities in order1 must be in order2.}

\item{order2}{The second rank ordering to be compared. Alternatively, this can
be supplied as an interaction matrixwith identities as the dimension names. 
All identities in order2 must be in order1.}
}
\value{
The proportion of dyadic relationship that are shared by the two orders
        This value is 1 if the orders are identical and 0 if the orders are
        exact opposites.
}
\description{
This function compares two rank orderings that have the same elements. 
     For an order of length \emph{n} 
     there are \emph{n choose 2} dyadic relationships implied by that order. 
     For example, the order {a, b, c} implies that a > b, a  > c, and b > c.
     The dyadic similarity between two orders is the proportion of implied 
     dyadic relationships that are shared by the two orders.
}
\examples{
dyadic_similarity(letters[1:20], letters[1:20]) #identical orders
dyadic_similarity(letters[1:20], letters[20:1]) #opposite orders
dyadic_similarity(sample(letters[1:20]), sample(letters[1:20])) #random orders
