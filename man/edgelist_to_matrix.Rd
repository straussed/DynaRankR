\title{Convert data from edgelist to interaction matrix}
\usage{
edgelist_to_matrix(edgelist, identities)
}
\arguments{
\item{edgelist}{A 2-column matrix or dataframe with the identities of winners in the first column and losers in the second column.}

\item{identities}{A list of contestant identities. 
This list dictates the order in which contestants are arranged in the resulting matrix.}
}
\value{
Produces an interaction matrix with winners in the rows and losers in the columns. 
        Contestants are arranged according to the order specified by identities.
}
\description{
This function converts data in edgelist format to an interaction matrix
}
\examples{
edges <- C.crocuta.female$interactions[C.crocuta.female$interactions$period == 1989,1:2]
ids <- C.crocuta.female$contestants[C.crocuta.female$contestants$period == 1989,'id']
edgelist_to_matrix(edgelist = edges, identities = ids)
